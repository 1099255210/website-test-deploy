**IEEE AIoT Conference 2023**

**Introduction:**

Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), refers to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT). This integration allows AIoT end, edge, and server devices connected to the internet, such as smart home devices and industrial equipment, they collect, analyze, and act on data in real time. The combination of AI and IoT enables a wide range of applications, including predictive maintenance, automation, and improved decision-making. For example, an AIoT system in the factory could monitor equipment and predict when it is likely to fail, allowing maintenance to be scheduled before a breakdown occurs. The AIoT system could optimize energy consumption in the smart home by learning a household's patterns and adjusting settings accordingly. The IEEE AIoT Conference 2023 is an event focused on the artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) intersection. The conference brings together researchers, industry professionals, and practitioners worldwide to share their latest findings, insights, and innovations. The IEEE AIoT Conference 2023 will include a highly selective program of technical papers accompanied by workshops, demos, panel discussions, and keynote speeches. We welcome high-quality articles that describe original and unpublished research advancing state of art in ubiquitous intelligence and computing.

Xi'an, known as Chang'an in ancient times, is one of world-famous four civilized capitals. As a capital, it lasted the longest with the most dynasties, making the greatest influence in Chinese history. As the start of the ancient Silk Road, it has played a unique role in promoting cultural exchanges between China and the West both in history and the future.

Xi’an is a combination of the classic and the modern. The inner city is surrounded by a well-preserved City wall which was re-constructed in the 14th century during the early Ming Dynasty. The Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang and his Terracotta Army are located 40 km to the east of the city center, in the city's suburbs. The Bell Tower and Drum Tower, both are located at the city's central axis. Meanwhile, Xi’an is open to high-tech and emerging industries. Many technology companies locate in Gaoxin Area. Based on the advanced research facilities and outstanding talents, Xi’an has a strong background on scientific research. In the past decades, this city has been making achievements in multiple areas.

Call for Paper: 2023 AIoTSys CAA Special Track 

1.	Introduction:

Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is considered a collaborative application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). With the fast growth of Internet of Things (IoT), vehicular networks, and the advent of 5G/6G, there are more rigorous performance requirements (e.g., ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability) for advanced communication and networking techniques that enable the emerging high mobility applications. 

Future AIoT systems will provide intelligent wireless connections with a high data rate for anyone at anytime and anywhere with the aid of AI, for example when traveling in high-speed trains and highway vehicles. These high mobility scenarios result in rapidly time-varying channels, which pose urgent demands for AI-empowered large-scale communications as well as significant challenges for the design of communication and networking models and technologies for AIoT. 

This Special CAA Track, sponsored by CCF-CAA, aims to collect original and high-quality submissions that target the relevant theoretical aspects and practical design of advanced communication and networking techniques for high mobility networks. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:
