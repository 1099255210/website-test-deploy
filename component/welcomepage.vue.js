            Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT), refers to the
            integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the
            Internet of Things (IoT). This integration allows AIoT end, edge,
            and server devices connected to the internet, such as smart home
            devices and industrial equipment, they collect, analyze, and act
            on data in real time. The combination of AI and IoT enables a wide
            range of applications, including predictive maintenance,
            automation, and improved decision-making. For example, an AIoT
            system in the factory could monitor equipment and predict when it
            is likely to fail, allowing maintenance to be scheduled before a
            breakdown occurs. The AIoT system could optimize energy
            consumption in the smart home by learning a household's patterns
            and adjusting settings accordingly.

              things and systems</strong
            >
            is an event focused on the artificial intelligence (AI) and the
            Internet of Things (IoT) intersection. The conference brings
            together researchers, industry professionals, and practitioners
            worldwide to share their latest findings, insights, and
            innovations. The AIoTSys 2023 will include a highly selective
            program of technical papers accompanied by workshops, demos, panel
            discussions, and keynote speeches. We welcome high-quality
            articles that describe original and unpublished research advancing
            state of art in ubiquitous intelligence and computing.
