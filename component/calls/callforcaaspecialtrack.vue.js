      <p class="conf-subtitle">1.Introduction:</p>

      <p class="main-p">
        Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) is considered a collaborative
        application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things
        (IoT). With the fast growth of Internet of Things (IoT), vehicular 
        networks, and the advent of 5G/6G, there are more rigorous performance
        requirements (e.g., ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability) for
        advanced communication and networking techniques that enable the
        emerging high mobility applications. 
      </p>

      <p class="main-p">
        Future AIoT systems will provide intelligent wireless connections 
        with a high data rate for anyone at anytime and anywhere with the 
        aid of AI, for example when traveling in high-speed trains and 
        highway vehicles. These high mobility scenarios result in rapidly 
        time-varying channels, which pose urgent demands for AI-empowered 
        large-scale communications as well as significant challenges for 
        the design of communication and networking models and technologies 
        for AIoT.
      </p>

      <p class="main-p">
        This Special CAA Track, sponsored by CCF-CAA, aims to collect original 
        and high-quality submissions that target the relevant theoretical 
        aspects and practical design of advanced communication and networking 
        techniques for high mobility networks. The topics of interest include 
        but are not limited to: 
      </p>
