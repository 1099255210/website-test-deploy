        Call for paper: 2023 AIoTSys <strong>SIGBED CHINA Special Track 
        (Artificial intelligent sensing with radio, light and acoustic)</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="conf-subtitle">1.Introduction:</p>
      
      <p class="main-p">
        With the fast growth of the artificial Internet of Things (AIoT),
        various ambient signals have been established as a powerful medium 
        for ubiquitous sensing, which quickly becomes an active cross-disciplinary 
        research area that involves wireless communication, signal processing, 
        machine learning, and even hardware design. The explosive progress in 
        mobile sensing, especially contactless sensing provides another dimension 
        to design and develop solutions and systems for many artificial intelligent 
        sensing problems. 
      </p>

      <p class="main-p">
        This Special CAA Track, sponsored by SIGBED CHINA, aims to collect original 
        and high-quality submissions that artificial intelligent sensing with 
        ambient radio, light and acoustic signals to solve problems in contactless 
        and non-intrusive sensing models and algorithms, AI-driven sensing 
        applications and solutions for all related field. The interested topics 
        include but not limited to:
