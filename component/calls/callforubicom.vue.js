      <p class="conf-subtitle">1.Introduction:</p>

      <p class="main-p">
      Due to improvements in their CPU/GPU capabilities, intelligent 
      mobile devices can now undertake more computing tasks. This 
      computational mechanism is called pervasive and mobile computing. 
      The proliferation of pervasive and mobile computing in intelligent 
      mobile devices is now regarded as an effective mechanism able to 
      assist or change human life. Ubiquitous computing through the 
      design and deployment of various pervasive and mobile computing 
      systems is able to sufficiently perceive various states of humans 
      and things, such as human activities, decision assistance, and 
      health care. It utilizes the computation power of intelligent 
      mobile devices to improve the quality of people's work and life, 
      proving its potential for pervasive and mobile computing. Ideally, 
      computing services will be efficient, reliable, and ubiquitous. 
      However, in reality, the implementation of adaptive and reliable 
      mobile computing systems is still challenging. Maintaining 
      robustness under dynamic network conditions, adapting to dynamic 
      and limited resource constraints, rational energy schedules, 
      protecting data privacy, etc., are still open problems. This 
      Special Issue provides an opportunity for researchers and system 
      developers to address research challenges facing the design, 
      development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of pervasive 
      and mobile computing systems. We submissions from various fields 
      related to pervasive and mobile computing, wireless communication 
      and networking, embedded systems and hardware, learning algorithms 
      and models, distributed systems and algorithms, data management, 
      and real-world measurement and deployment for mobile systems and 
      applications. Papers on theoretical, practical, and methodological 
      issues in pervasive and mobile computing are welcome. Potential 
      topics include, but are not limited to:
