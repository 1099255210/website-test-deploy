      <p class="conf-subtitle">1.Introduction:</p>

      <p class="main-p">
        The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to play a significant role in creating a more 
        sustainable and green future. With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
        technology, AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) has recently become a hot topic that 
        combines two of the hottest acronyms. Empowered by AI, IoT enables a variety of intelligent 
        services across a myriad of fields for smart cities and industries including manufacturing 
        and agriculture, by performing integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC). 
        In this context, to keep pace with the explosive growth of AIoT traffic, wireless systems 
        must support ultra-high bandwidth, low latency, reliable connections, and flexible resource 
        allocation. Despite a great amount of effort made regarding applying AI to IoT, AIoT still 
        faces technical challenges while designing and deploying ISCC techniques in practice. For 
        instance, complexity, efficiency, scalability, accuracy, and robustness related to the 
        increasing modern AIoT systems and applications. This Special Track is aimed at collecting 
        original and innovative research works that focus on challenging issues in the field of 
        ISCC technologies and applications in AIoT.
