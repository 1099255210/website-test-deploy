      <p class="conf-subtitle">1.Summary</p>
      
      <p class="main-p">
        Recently, the combination of AI and edge computing for IoT has aroused a 
        research upsurge, which helps to achieve efficient computing and intelligent 
        decision-making to ensure the QoS requirements of IoT devices. By deploying 
        intelligence-empowered edge servers, inference computing of IoT devices can 
        be achieved with higher accuracy and lower latency. However, integrating AI 
        with edge computing in the IoT system still raises several major challenges 
        in various aspects of algorithm design, resource allocation, security, 
        privacy, incentive mechanism, etc. This Special Track aims to exploit AI and 
        edge computing-empowered IoT from several perspectives, ranging from its 
        recent advances to intelligent communication/networking technologies. This 
        Special Track will bring together leading researchers from both the industry 
        and academia and solicit their original research and practical contributions 
        on novel architectures, applications, and technologies of AI and edge 
        computing-empowered IoT. We encourage prospective authors to submit related 
        distinguished research papers on the subject of both: theoretical approaches 
        and practical case reviews.
