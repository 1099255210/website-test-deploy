        Non-Presented Paper (No-Show) Policy: Any accepted paper included in the final program 
        is expected to have at least one author or qualified proxy attend and present the paper 
        at the conference. If a paper is not presented at the conference, the paper will not be 
        published by IEEE on IEEE XploreÂ® or other public access forums, but these papers will 
        be distributed to conference attendees as conference proceedings and the copyright of 
        these papers will belong to IEEE.  
      </p>
      <p class="main-p">
        Exceptions to this policy will be made by the Technical Program Chair(s) of 
        the conference only if there is evidence that the no-show occurred because of 
        unanticipated events beyond the control of the authors, and every option available 
        to the authors to present the paper was exhausted. The no-show authors may 
        appeal the decision of the Technical Program Chair to the VP-Conferences.
      </p>
