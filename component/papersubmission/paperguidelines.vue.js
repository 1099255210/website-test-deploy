      <p class="conf-title">AIoTSys Paper Submission and Guidelines</p>
      <p class="main-p">
        Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length papers (up
        to 8 pages including references), short papers (up to 4 pages
        including references), or extended abstracts , via the AIoTSys
        2023 conference website. Manuscripts should be original (not
        submitted/published anywhere else) and written in accordance with
        the standard double-column paper template. The accepted abstracts
        will not be published, however the abstracts and/or the
        presentations will be included in AIoTSys 2023 conference program.

      <p class="main-p">
        All papers are reviewed using a single-blind review process: 
        authors declare their names and affiliations in the manuscript 
        for the reviewers to see, but reviewers do not know each other's 
        identities, nor do the authors receive information about who has 
        reviewed their manuscript.

        The reviewing process of the ICSIP conference aims to provide
        authors with constructive feedback on their papers, even when a
        submission is rejected. All submissions will be subjected to 
        single-blind peer reviews, who are expert or have been
        experiencing in the related field for years. The accepted papers
        must be revised, taking into consideration the referees' comments
        and suggestions, before inclusion in the conference proceedings.
      </p>

      <p class="conf-subtitle">Paper Presentation</p>
      <p class="main-p">
        All accepted paper should have at least one author or qualified
        proxy registered and attend/present the paper at the conference.
        Authors who anticipate inability to travel to a conference because
        of a government-imposed travel restriction are still encouraged to
        submit papers. Such papers will be reviewed and accepted on their
        own merit for publication in Conference Proceedings, without any
        knowledge of the author's travel restriction. Within one week of
        paper acceptance notification, travel-restricted authors must
        notify the conference secretary with proof of their restriction.
        Substitute presenters may be possible or, depending on conference
        resources, such as a remote presentation or pre-recorded video.
